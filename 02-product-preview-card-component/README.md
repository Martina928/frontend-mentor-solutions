## My process

1. Make the wireframe for viewport of mobile and desktop
2. Plan the class names
3. Setup the HTML structure
4. Apply CSS styles

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first challenge with RWD design at Frontend Mentor. The break point is 550px by using flex to change the layout.

In the HTML structure, I used to use `<div>` and change the different background with different viewport sizes. For building semantic HTML markup, I tried to use `<picture> + <source>` tag to set media query. So that the product image can switch in different device without CSS.

### Useful resources

- [[HTML5] Picture element, srcset for Responsive Images](https://pjchender.dev/html/html-picture-srcset/) - This helped me for understanding how to use picture element, srcset and media attribute to deal with responsive images.
