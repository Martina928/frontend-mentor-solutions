## My process

1. Make the wireframe and plan the class names
2. Setup the HTML structure
3. Apply CSS styles

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first challenge at Frontend Mentor. 

I tried to use BEM naming for the class names, and use relative units rather than absolute units in CSS style. 

I used `margin` attribute for `.card ` to align center in the beginning. However, it would be a problem when the height of viewport shrink. Then, I used `Flexbox` to deal with this question. So that the card will be placed in the center at any viewport size.
